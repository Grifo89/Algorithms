Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

INPUT 
-----
- A string.

OUTPUT 
------
- An integer, de length of the longest palindrom.

PSEUDOCODE
---------------
1. generate ell the subsequences of the given string and find the longest.
    a. Check if the last and first character are the same, if they are, both are consider in the final palindrom. 
    b. Add 2 to the answer variable and recursively remove the first and last characters from the remaining substring.
